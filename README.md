# grunt-wpt

> Grunt task for WebPageTest

### Automated performance analysis thanks to the magic of WebPageTest

grunt-wpt is a [Grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/) task for automating performance analysis and enforce a performance budget. It uses the wonderful [webpagetest.org](http://webpagetest.org) and the [WebPageTest API Wrapper for NodeJS](https://github.com/marcelduran/webpagetest-api) created by [Marcel Duran](https://github.com/marcelduran).

grunt-wpt uses either a public or private instance of WebPageTest to perform tests on a specified URL. It compares test results to budgets you specify. If the budget is met, the tasks successfully completes. If it the page exceeds your performance budgets, the task fails and informs you why.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-wpt --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-wpt');
```

## The "wpt" task

  },
});
```
